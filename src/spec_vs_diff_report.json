REQ-51 (deployment rollback + keeping broken build accessible separately without data loss) is not evidenced in the diff summary.",

      "requirement": "Restore the last known working deployed version as the primary production version, and keep the currently-deployed (broken) version accessible separately for troubleshooting (without deleting/replacing the previous working deployment), ensuring no backend data loss.",
      "reason": "The diff only shows frontend code changes (version label, health gate, error boundary, connectivity-aware UI/hooks). There is no evidence of deployment configuration/hosting changes, routing to serve two deployed versions (prod vs separate preview/versioned path), or any rollback mechanism that would switch production traffic back to a previous deployment while keeping the broken one accessible.",
