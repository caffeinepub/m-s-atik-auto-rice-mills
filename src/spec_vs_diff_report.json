  "summary": "The diff implements centralized replica-rejection extraction and standardized English admin-auth error messaging, updates admin login to surface controlled error text, and updates admin route token-validation gating to preserve tokens during IC0508/canister-stopped backend outages while showing an English backend-unavailable message.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Unrelated feature changes are described (e.g., GalleryPage updates, HeaderNav logout button, useLogout changes, AdminLayout routing changes, App router nesting, AdminNotFound page, useQueries updates), but these are not requested by REQ-31/32/33 and are only evidenced as claims inside a summary file rather than shown code diffs.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is narrowly scoped to admin login/token-validation handling for canister-stopped errors and standardized rejection parsing/messages; the diff summary file includes additional change descriptions outside that scope.",
