  "summary": "Website project for M/S Atik Auto Rice Mills: build a unique modern website using www.atikautoricemills.com as a reference/source of information, and include an admin panel (CMS) to edit/modify all site content.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Content should be manageable via an admin panel (CMS) with ability to edit/modify all site content.",
    "Decision: if no admin is configured in the canister, the first Internet Identity principal to log in will be auto-assigned as admin (bootstrap admin).",
    "Add an explicit Logout action in the frontend that ends the Internet Identity session (e.g., via useInternetIdentity().logout()) so users can re-authenticate and trigger first-login admin bootstrap when applicable.",
    "Requested change: replace/admin panel login mechanism with a basic username/password credential (admin/admin) instead of Internet Identity.",
    "Add a deployment rollback/previous-version retention strategy so a known-good version can remain live or be restored quickly if a new version fails."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Admin panel access denied: current Internet Identity principal not recognized as admin; backend appears to have no admin configured / access-control list missing, blocking all admin access.",
    "Build/deploy automation failed to apply the intended backend update (\"AI couldn't complete your request\").",
    "No logout option in the UI, preventing users from ending their Internet Identity session and re-authenticating to trigger the first-login admin bootstrap flow.",
    "Password-based admin login (admin/admin) still results in \"Unauthorized: Only admins can assign user roles\" after submitting credentials; login session/token is not being recognized/applied and the admin panel continues to behave as if not logged in (old admin-check logic still active or session not persisted).",
    "After submitting admin credentials, UI remains stuck on the login page and does not navigate/open the admin panel (login success state/session not applied or routing not triggered).",
    "Admin panel navigation items (Site Settings, Page Sections, Products, Gallery, Contact Info, Messages) lead to \"Not Found\"—admin sub-routes are missing/misconfigured or routing/basePath is incorrect in production build.",
    "adminLogin calls are failing with IC0508 (reject code 5) because the backend canister (ry7no-ryaaa-aaaag-aww3q-cai) is stopped, causing replica rejection errors.",
    "Public website landing page is stuck on a \"loading content\" state (content fetch/initialization or frontend data-loading is not completing), blocking the homepage from rendering.",
    "After deploying Version 10 to production, the public landing page renders blank (white screen) instead of showing content or a loading/error state.",
    "User reports that after Version 11 deployment, \"everything not working\" (site broadly broken/unusable beyond the specific backend-connection error), indicating a wider regression requiring end-to-end diagnostics."
